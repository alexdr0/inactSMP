# inactSMP

Welcome to the InactSMP Github Repository. Here is our Website and our TypeScript Plugin. 

For Pull Requests 

### Website

Our Website is made in [TypeScript React](https://reactjs.org). You can see the Source code in the ``/web`` folder.

Currently the Website is in development, the website will *(hopefully)* run on [smp.alexdr.tech](https://smp.alexdr.tech) and that is the same IP as our server.

### TypeScript InactSMP Plugin

The InactSMP plugin or ``Inact >>`` in the console, uses [ScriptCraft](https://github.com/walterhiggins/ScriptCraft) to send API reuqests to the server using TypeScript (JavaScript).
